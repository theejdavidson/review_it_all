## Project FAQ
#### 1. What is Review It All?
A reddit-like platform in which users may review whatever they have the sudden urge to review. 

#### 2. How does it work?
After creating an account, users can search for specific Subjects and create 'reviews' or posts. Users will be able to interact with other users posts and upvote or downvote. A user will naturally have the ability to edit or delete their own posts as well of course.

#### 3. What is the problem this product solves?
No Advertisements... This doesn't solve world hunger or bring about world peace however, the creation of a basic platform like this will let users speak wholeheartedly about subjects they're passionate about.
